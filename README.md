# Library-Management-System


     
             You have to write a C program to implement the following console-based mini 
project. 
Project Description: 
The Library Management System is a console-based application that helps users 
manage books in a library. It allows users to add new books, search for books by title or 
author, and view all available books. This system ensures efficient book management 
by storing book details in an array. 
Project Features: 
Add a Book: 
● Users can add a new book by entering its title, author, and ISBN. 
● The system stores this information in the library catalog. 
Search for a Book: 
● Users can search for a book using its title or author. 
● If found, the system displays the book's details; otherwise, it informs the user that 
the book is not available. 
View All Books: 
● Displays a list of all books in the library, including their title, author, and ISBN. 
Exit the System: 
● Allows users to exit the application when they’re done. 
Concepts Required: 
● Arrays, Loops, If-Else, String
